Tiling Architecture.

Let's start easy.

TileManager:
	1. vector<TileLayer>  <-----<	pointer
	2. TileBuilder    ----------^

TileLayer:
	A vector<TileTypes> that locally stores all TileTypes queried from TileBuilder. A TileType is actually just an sf::Sprite that stores sf::Texture* and TextureRect.
	A vector<Tile> that locally stores all the Tile info loaded from a file.
	A vector<sf::VertexArray> for each TileType.

	Here's the fun stuff:
		1. The Tile holds world co-ordinates and index of TileType. This is achieved by reading order of TileTypes from file, putting it in a small map, and then assigning indices from that map to the Tile objects based on their std::string tile names.

TileBuilder:
	A Tilemap Manager that can load and hold spritesheets.
